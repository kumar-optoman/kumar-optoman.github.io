		<font face = "Times New Roman" size = "4.5"><p>An algorithm to retrieve phase from a single diffracted intensity image. Algorithm combines the state-of-art reconstruction ability of deep learning and the excellent generalization of physical model based methods.
		Shown below is a phase image of some unstained human cells cultured on a PDMS medium. Unstained cells are nearly transparent. Imaging hardware setup is same as project 04 but the reconstruction is obtained using this novel computational framework.Â
