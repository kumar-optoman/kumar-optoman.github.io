		<font face = "Times New Roman" size = "4.5"><p>In holography and coded aperture imaging, the resolution of the reconstructed image depends on the spatial frequency bandwidth of the impulse response function. In holography, a monochromatic light filtered with a spatial filter like a pinhole aperture of diameter half micron to five microns (or a single mode optical fiber) is generally used to illuminate the sample for obtaining a high bandwidth impulse response function. The objective of this project is to develop a computational imaging method to obtain high resolution holographic in-line microscopy with a spatially extended and polychromatic light source and eliminate the above mentioned restrictions. The objective is important for speckle free imaging and in the development of more compact holographic imaging systems.
